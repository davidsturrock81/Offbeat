  <h2>Who are Off Beat Digital?</h2>
  <p>
    Hello! I'm David Sturrock, a skilled and versatile web developer with a strong command of Java and React, and a proven ability to deliver dynamic, user-focused digital solutions.

With a foundation rooted in business leadership and education, I bring a uniquely holistic perspective to software development, one that combines technical precision with strategic thinking and human-centered design. My transition into tech wasnâ€™t a leap, but a natural progression of my passion for building, improving, and solving complex problems.

I specialize in creating responsive, efficient, and visually engaging web applications, drawing on a deep understanding of front-end and back-end development principles. My expertise in Java, React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is complemented by a sharp eye for detail, a commitment to clean code, and a constant drive to stay current with emerging technologies.

Prior to my work in tech, I spent over two decades leading high-performing teams in the hospitality sector, successfully turning around businesses, elevating brand standards, and delivering exceptional customer experiences. This hands-on experience has made me results-driven, adaptable, and deeply attuned to both user and organizational needs.

Additionally, my background as a TEFL-certified educator in Thailand sharpened my communication skills and strengthened my ability to convey complex ideas in accessible ways, qualities that now serve me well in both collaborative development environments and user experience design.

Today, I integrate these experiences seamlessly into my development practice, combining business intelligence, technical skill, and creative problem-solving to build web applications that not only function flawlessly but also deliver real value.
